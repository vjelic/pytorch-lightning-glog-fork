This is a form of injection attack, where an attacker can inject malicious code or commands into the program. In the provided code example, `call(\" \".join(joint_cmd), shell=True)`, the `shell=True` argument allows for the execution of shell commands, which can be exploited if `joint_cmd` can be manipulated by an attacker.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `shell=True` in subprocess calls whenever possible. If shell commands must be used, ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks. \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of using `shell=True`, use a list of arguments for the subprocess call. This way, the command and its arguments are passed to the system call directly, which avoids shell interpretation.\n\nHere is a fixed version of the provided code:\n\n```python\nfrom subprocess import call\n\n# Assuming joint_cmd is a list of command and its arguments\nresult = call(joint_cmd)\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the `subprocess` library, which is included in the standard Python library.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)\n- [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)"

This function is vulnerable to a security issue where it does not validate or sanitize the URL scheme. This means that an attacker can provide a URL with a malicious scheme (like file:// or data://) that can lead to unwanted behavior, such as reading local files or executing arbitrary commands.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should always validate and sanitize any URLs that you pass to `urlretrieve()`. This includes checking the URL scheme and ensuring that it is one of the permitted schemes (like http:// or https://). You should also be wary of any URLs that are provided by untrusted sources, such as user input or external services.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple way to check the URL scheme before passing it to `urlretrieve()`:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\nimport urllib.request\n\ndef safe_urlretrieve(url, fpath):\n    scheme = urlparse(url).scheme\n    if scheme not in ['http', 'https']:\n        raise ValueError('Invalid URL scheme: {}'.format(scheme))\n    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, fpath)\n```\n\nIn this code, `urlparse()` is used to parse the URL and extract the scheme. If the scheme is not 'http' or 'https', a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following Python standard libraries:\n\n- urllib.parse\n- urllib.request\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n\nPlease note that the CWE link refers to a more general class of vulnerabilities (Server-Side Request Forgery), but it includes the issue described here (unvalidated URL schemes leading to unwanted behavior)."
